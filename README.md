A script to automatically download rosters from my.cs.illinois.edu.
Super hacky, so don't judge plz.

Installation:

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

For usage information, refer to

    python download_roster.py -h

Google virtualenv if you're unfamliar with it. In general, you'll need
to activate the virtual environment to be able to run the script:

    source venv/bin/activate

and then deactivate it once you're done:

    deactivate
