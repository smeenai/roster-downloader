A script to automatically download rosters from my.cs.illinois.edu.
Super hacky, so don't judge plz.

Installation:

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Google virtualenv if you're unfamliar with it, and don't forget to
deactivate the enviroment once you're done:

    deactivate

For usage information, refer to

    python download_roster.py -h
